# Assumptions

This folder stores assumption logs and test plans produced while derisking opportunities and solutions.

## File Naming

- `assumptions-[opportunity-name]-v[version].md`

## Where These Come From

Use the continuous-discovery skill's "identify and test assumptions" workflow. Outputs should be saved here.

## Suggested Structure

```markdown
# Assumptions -- [Opportunity Name]

## Story Map Snapshot
- Actors and key steps that reveal risky moments

## Assumption Log
| ID | Category | Assumption | Evidence | Importance | Evidence Known | LoFA |

## Assumption Map (Summary)
- Top-right LoFA priorities

## Test Cards (LoFA)
- Hypothesis, simulation, method, audience, n & window, success criteria, next steps

## Results and Decisions
- What we learned and what changes next
```

## Workflow

1. Start from a prioritized opportunity in `opportunities/`.
2. Create an assumptions file here and identify LoFA assumptions.
3. Run smallest viable tests; record results and decisions.
4. Update ideas/opportunities based on evidence.

---
Keep assumptions positive, specific, and tied to observable behavior.
